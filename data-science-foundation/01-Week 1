Introduction - Week 1 Session 1

The topics for this week are:

•	Introduction to the circle
•	Defining Data Science and What Data Scientists Do
•	Skills required for a career in data science

Welcome! we'll unpack the what, why, and how of data science. By the end of this program, you'll have a better grasp of how data is being used around you and how you can use data.
If we Google "What is data science?", we'll see a huge amount of confusing information.
But data science is actually simple. It's a set of methodologies for taking in thousands of forms of data that are available to us today and using them to draw meaningful conclusions. Data is being collected all around us. Every like, click, email, credit card swipe, or tweet is a new piece of data that can be used to better describe the present or better predict the future.
So what can data do? Data can describe our current state, like our energy consumption. This can be accomplished with dashboards or alerts, simplifying time-intensive reporting processes. It can help detect anomalous events, such as fraudulent purchases. If we have data on what has happened previously, we can increase efficiency by automatically detecting a new event that is unexpected or abnormal. Data can also diagnose the causes of observed events and behaviors, for instance your activity on Spotify or Netflix. Rather than determining correlations between small numbers of events, data science techniques help us understand complex systems with many possible causes. Finally, data can predict future events, such as forecasting population size. We can use new techniques to take various causes into account and predict potential outcomes. Further, we can evaluate the probability of our prediction mathematically to clarify our level of uncertainty.
So now we know what data science is. The next question is why is it so popular? The answer is pretty obvious: we're collecting more data than ever before. Suppose that you visit a car dealership and fill out some information.
All of that data is automatically entered into a computer, and combined with the data from hundreds of dealerships into one big database.
Once we have that data, it's easy to use the email address that you provided when you bought that car to tie your car purchase data with your data from social media or web browsing. Suddenly, we have a very complete picture about everyone who purchased a car in the last year: their ages, their likes and dislikes, their friends and family. This additional data can be used to predict what price you can pay for your car, what other purchases you're likely to make, or how best to sell you insurance for that new car. Data is everywhere, and it is incredibly valuable information for businesses, organizations, and governments.
So, how do we start to use data? In data science, we generally have four steps to any project. First, we collect data from many sources, such as surveys, web traffic results, geo-tagged social media posts, and financial transactions. Once collected, we store that data in a safe and accessible way.
At this point, data is in its raw form, so the next step is to prepare data. This includes "cleaning data", for instance finding missing or duplicate values, and converting data into a more organized format.
Then, we explore and visualize the cleaned data. This could involve building dashboards to track how the data changes over time or performing comparisons between two sets of data.
Finally, we run experiments and predictions on the data. For example, this could involve building a system that forecasts temperature changes or performing a test to find which web page acquires more customers.
Now, you know why data science is important and the first four steps in the data science workflow. Let's explore data science in detail.

Session 1:
What is data science?
Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.
Let's look at other definitions:
Data science can be defined as the scientific study of data to gain knowledge. This field combines multiple disciplines to extract knowledge from massive datasets for the purpose of making informed decisions and predictions. Data scientists, data analysts, data architects, data engineers, statisticians, database administrators, and business analysts all work in the data science field.
The need for data science is growing rapidly as the amount of data increases exponentially and companies depend more heavily on analytics to drive revenue and innovation. For example, as business interactions become more digital, more data is created, presenting new opportunities to derive insights into how to better personalize experiences, improve service and customer satisfaction, develop new and enhanced products, and increase sales. Additionally, in the business world and beyond, data science has the potential to help solve some of the world's most difficult challenges.

 
What is a Data Scientists and what do they do?
What is a Data Scientist
A data scientist leads research projects to extract valuable information from big data and is skilled in technology, mathematics, business, and communications. Organizations use this information to make better decisions, solve complex problems, and improve their operations. By revealing actionable insights hidden in large datasets, a data scientist can significantly improve his or her company’s ability to achieve its goals. That's why data scientists are in high demand and even considered "rock stars" in the business world.
What does a data scientist do?
A data scientist collects, analyzes, and interprets big data to uncover patterns and insights, make predictions, and create actionable plans. Big data can be defined as datasets that have greater variety, volume, and velocity than earlier methods of data management were equipped to handle. Data scientists work with many types of big data, including:
•	Structured data, which is typically organized in rows and columns and includes words and numbers such as names, dates, and credit card information. For example, a data scientist in the utility industry might analyze tables of power generation and usage data to help reduce costs and detect patterns that could cause equipment to fail.  In the context of a financial institution like a bank, a data scientist may analyze structured data, such as the financial transaction histories of customers, to identify trends and insights. Additionally, data scientists may use structured data to develop predictive models to identify customers who are more likely to default on their loans or credit card payments and take steps to mitigate those risks. Overall, structured data is an important component of data science and can be leveraged in many different industries to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
•	Unstructured data, which is unorganized and includes text in document files, social media and mobile data, website content, and videos. For example, a data scientist in the retail industry might answer a question about improving the customer experience by analyzing unstructured call center notes, emails, surveys, and social media posts. A data scientist working in healthcare might analyze unstructured data from electronic medical records, patient-generated data, social media posts, and other sources to identify trends and patterns that could lead to better patient outcomes, more efficient healthcare delivery, and improved public health. For instance, a data scientist could analyze patient notes and doctor's reports to identify common symptoms and patterns of illness, which could help doctors diagnose and treat patients more effectively. They could also analyze social media posts to identify outbreaks of illnesses or track the spread of diseases in real-time, enabling healthcare providers to respond quickly and effectively to public health threats.  
Additionally, the characteristics of the dataset can be described as quantitative, structured numerical data, or qualitative or categorical data, which is not represented through numerical values and can be grouped based on categories. It's important for data scientists to know the type of data they're working with, as it directly impacts the type of analyses they perform and the types of graphs they can use to visualize the data.
Here are some examples of quantitative, structured numerical data, and qualitative or categorical data:
Quantitative, structured numerical data:
1.	Sales revenue for each quarter of a year. Sales revenue for each quarter of a year is a structured data because it can be organized in a tabular format with rows and columns, where each row represents a specific quarter and each column represents a particular category of revenue (such as total revenue, revenue from a particular product line, or revenue from a specific region). The data can be represented in numerical values, making it quantitative and structured. Data scientists can easily use this data to create graphs and charts that can be used to identify trends, patterns, and insights to help the business make informed decisions. 
2.	Number of customers who visited a website each day for a month.
3.	Temperature readings for each hour of a day for a week.
4.	The weight of different products manufactured in a factory. Here is a question for discussion. 
Conversation starter 1: It is pretty clear from the explanation that point 1 (i.e., sales revenue) can be classified as an example of structured data. 
Take a look at points 2, 3, and 4 on the list, are they examples of structured data? Explain why or why not. This question will be discussed later during the group discussion session. 
Qualitative or categorical data:
•	Types of fruits sold in a grocery store. Types of fruits sold in a grocery store is a categorical data because it consists of categories or groups that are not represented by numerical values. In this case, the categories are the different types of fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, etc. The data cannot be quantified or measured using numerical values, but rather it can only be grouped based on these categories. 
•	Colors of T-shirts available in a clothing store. Colors of T-shirts available in a clothing store is an example of categorical data because the colors are not numerical values and cannot be measured on a numeric scale. Instead, the colors are grouped into categories, such as red, blue, green, black, etc. Categorical data is also sometimes referred to as qualitative data because it is descriptive and not based on numerical values. In this case, the data is qualitative because it is based on color categories rather than numerical values. 
•	Ratings of a product or service on a scale of 1 to 5. Ratings of a product or service on a scale of 1 to 5 is actually an example of quantitative data, as it represents a numerical value. Categorical data represents characteristics that can be grouped into categories or labels, such as the types of fruits sold in a grocery store or the colors of T-shirts available in a clothing store. Examples of categorical data in the context of ratings might include the category of product or service being rated (e.g. electronics, household appliances, restaurants, hotels) or the type of rating (e.g. positive, negative, neutral). 
•	Feedback from customers in the form of open-ended comments.  
Conversation starter 2: How can feedback from customers be considered categorical data, and what are the reasons for this classification? This question will serve as a basis for discussion later during our study group session.  
To gain knowledge from all these data types, data scientists utilize their skills in:
•	Computer programming. Data scientists write queries using languages such as Julia, R, or Python to pull data from their company's database. Python is the language of choice for many data scientists because it's easy to learn and use, even for people without coding experience, and offers prebuilt data science modules for data analysis. This statement about Python being the language of choice for many data scientists because it's easy to learn and use, even for people without coding experience, and offers prebuilt data science modules for data analysis, is arguable. While Python is a popular language for data scientists, it may not be the language of choice for everyone. Some data scientists may prefer languages like R or Julia for certain tasks. Additionally, ease of use and prebuilt modules may not be the most important factors for some data scientists when choosing a language. Some may prioritize performance or the availability of specific libraries or tools.
Furthermore, the statement implies that Python is easy to learn and use for people without coding experience, but this may not be universally true. While Python is generally considered to be a beginner-friendly language, learning any programming language still requires effort and dedication. Some people may find other languages easier to learn based on their background or learning style.
Therefore, while Python is a popular choice for many data scientists, the statement is not necessarily true for everyone, and the reasons for choosing a programming language can vary depending on the individual and the specific requirements of their work. 
•	Conversation starter 3: What is your preferred option between Python and R, and what are the reasons behind your choice? Let's discuss this topic later during our study group session for those who have already started using both languages. 
•	Mathematics, statistics, and probability. Data scientists draw on these skills to analyze data, test hypotheses, and build machine learning models—files that data scientists train to recognize certain types of patterns. Data scientists use trained machine learning models to discover the relationships in data, make predictions about data, and figure out solutions to problems. Instead of building and training models from scratch, data scientists can also take advantage of automated machine learning to access production-ready machine learning models.
•	Domain knowledge. To translate data into relevant and meaningful insights that drive business outcomes, data scientists also need domain knowledge and an understanding of the industry and company where they work. 
•	There's another skill that's critical to the question and it also provides answers to the question "What does a data scientist do?". Effectively communicating the results of their analyses to managers, executives, and other stakeholders is one of the most important parts of the job. Data scientists need to make their findings easy to understand for a non-technical audience, so they can use the insights to make informed decisions. Therefore, data scientists need to be skilled in:
o	Communications, public speaking, and data visualization. Great data scientists have strong verbal communication skills, including storytelling and public speaking. In the field of data science, a picture is truly worth a thousand words. Presenting data science findings using graphs and charts enables the audience to quickly understand the data, in as little as five seconds or less. For that reason, successful data scientists take their data visualizations as seriously as their analyses.
